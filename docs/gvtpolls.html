Poll: Remove PoP from protocol.<br>

Introduction: Without PoP developer, we are "spreading" almost 50% of new coins using a unknown close source algorithm that is impossible to monitorize, replicate or verify. New mainnet and protocol can be siwtched instantly to : MNs 90% -project 10% (and be reverted if needed.) <br>

Proposal: Add PoP % inmediatelty to MNs to avoid exploits, until a better proposal can be developed open source.<br>

<p> — 04/07/2023 11:08 AM<br>Poll: Listing of NOSO on txbit<br>

Intoduction: We are in the exciting phase of lifting NOSO onto the public stage through an official listing on the exchange Txbit which will result in the subsequent automatic listing on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap. NOSO has reached out to txbit and after considering the listing efforts on their side, it was decided that listing fees will be 5000 $ (five thousand US Dollars, with no extra charge for liquidity). We therefore need to reach an agreement on multiple aspects of this listing process. <br>

@bermello (lead dev) agrees to pay for the txbit listing (5,000$) in exchange of 20,000 Noso (twenty thousand) from the project funds to be transferred to him when those funds are accessible (currently they can't be transferred). 
Estripa / Anisetin with the help of @Freshman will proceed with the listing process as soon as this poll gets majority. Time of listing is to be expected to occur after the next major mainnet update (earliest end of April 2023). This decision can be revoked before the payment is done if the governors detect a potential scam threat, returning the funds (5000 USDT) to @bermello.<br>
Exchange will take up to 14 days to list after the payment, and it includes up to 2 pairs.<br>

Trading pair choices are either NOSO / USDT or NOSO / BTC, preference to be defined on a later stage.<br>


Options:<br><b>
1) [25] I vote IN FAVOR of the above proposal. I therefore accept to let the lead dev pay for the listing fees in exchange of 20k Noso.<br></b>
2) [00] I vote AGAINST the proposal (no listing and therefore no Noso transferred to Bermello when coins available).<br>

	<p> 02/14/2023 7:15 PM<br>	Poll: Block addresses after receive a MN payment. <br>
	Introduction:	Main idea is to avoid massive sells that could lead to mainnet unstability. If many MNs owners suddenly decide to sell after Noso is listed or liquidity pool is released, it will lead to a massive reduction on the active masternodes (the one which support mainnet) It should be usual that around 50% of circulating supply is used to get MNs payments.
	<br>
	In order to avoid this, it is commonly used to block withdraws from addresses earning from masternodes for a determined period to avoid this. This is intended to bring stability to the mainnet and the coin price.
	<br>
	Proposal: Block withdraws for any address receiving a Masternode payment for the next 2016 blocks (2 weeks).

          Introduction: In order to speed up development, the possibility to run
          a pool is needed to speed up tests before releases; mainly, It is

        <p> — 12/10/2022 1:32 AM<br>Poll: Freeze forever GPU mined coins. <br>
          Introduction: We all know very well the impact GPU miners had on the
          project. In order to minimize it, we can freeze those coins before any
          monetization is open. Idea is to keep the addresses containing the
          funds freezed at first stage, and then move those funds to a special
          "dead" address, so will be never used. No one, not even the project,
          will get a direct benefit from that. (only the indirect: less coins
          increase others coins relative value) To make it in a safer way, the
          addresses will be locked and then the proofs will be made public.
          Proofs are solid and will include only addresses beyond any rational
          doubt. Total amount is around 100-150K noso. <br>
          Proposal: Freeze all GPU related addresses. This means that this
          address will not be able to send funds again. If any GVT is involved,
          it will be also freezed. <br>

          Introduction: Gpu miners had been swarming around Noso for quite a
          while and they collected between 50k - 300k+ Noso; finally shared the
          source code only after the threat of consequences for those coins,
          which was not even a good code and only after they make a huge profit.

          Introduction: Calculation of 57 shares per block was based in 1 pool
          and a 100 Kh/s miner. Now we have 5 pools and we should try to adjust
          that number to level even more the rewards for small miners,
          discouraging farmers. <br>
          Proposal: Reduce the shares per block to 10 on each pool to keep a

        <p> — 11/14/2022 8:18 AM<br>Poll: Mine undisputed blocks to project address. <br>
          Introduction: Current PoPW system could be hijacked if someone realize
          a DDoS attack to all available pools (paying for a DDoS protection
          service can be a big waste for pool owners, making it unprofitable).
          This will leave the mainnet without a valid besthash to build a new
          block, stopping the block generation under current protocol
          conditions. Since solo is now not allowed, block generation requires
          pools and are only few. <br>
          Proposal: Implement on protocol that blocks without a valid besthash
          are credited to project funds address NpryectdevepmentfundsGE to
          guarantee the blockchain continuity. This will prevent any exploit
          because only benefits the project itself, and protect the blockchain

          Introduction:<br>
          In order to handle future requirements, project should start to create
          a project funds reserve. Control of those funds could lead to
          problems, so the better way to control it is to implement a special
          address (called Noso_Project_Funds_xx, where xx will be the checksum);
          its funds will be only accessed via GVTs votations (directives). This
          can be done adding a "Special address" on sumary via a especial
          protocol instruction. This address do not have keys (public or
          private), since it will be a special identity inside the protocol,
          only used to store project funds. Apart from the difference to access
          the funds, all other things will be identical to a regular address;
          public, can verifiy its history, get MNs payments, be used to mine,
          etc. <br>

          Introduction: The implemented system for the distribution of new
          coins, POPW, depends on the allowed pools being reliable. It is easy
          to determine if a pool is trying to exploit the system and take action
          against it to suspend it. It is therefore advisable to apply minimum
          criteria to accept new pools. <br>

          distribution? <br>
          Introduction: <br>
          Some weeks ago, due to a sudden increment in the mainnet hashrate, and
          after some forensic study to the blocks solutions, it was clear that
          someone were using a non-public software to win an advantage over
          other miners. It is imposible to know exactly what is the GPU hashrate
          in the mainnet now, but is surely way more than 50%. This is causing
          an unethical and serious damage to the project, unfairly distributing
          coins and discouraging small miners to join or remain in the project;
          we are not actually attractive to miners anyway. <br>
          Proposition: <br>
          Reduce the PoW % from current 52% to 5%, at least until a better
          solution is found. This can be done in less than 24 hours in a safe
          way and should reduce the impact since MNs are already very well
          distributed. Keep a 5% is necessary to secure some miners active,
          needed for block generation currently. <br>

        <p> — 11/05/2022 3:16 AM<br>Poll: Merge MNs and PoS? <br>
          Introduction: <br>
          On the project early stages, PoS payment was implemented to reward
          first holders to keep their coins (hold) This was implemented as a
          temp feature until MNs payment was implemeted. Of course, MNs is
          already implemented, so there is no real need to keep those payments
          separate and continue rewarding "dead" wallets. <br>
          Proposition: <br>
          Merge PoS reward to MNs payment, so the 20% currently distributed
          between all addresses with enough coins are added to the MNs payment;
          this means that 100% passive income will dissapear. <br>

          <b>1) [38] Yes, do the merge ASAP.</b><br>
          2) [00] No, keep it as it is now.<br>
          3) [00] Not clear proposal.<br>
          4) [00] Another option (please, include details)<br>
          5) [00] Fake proposal. <br>
