        <p> Poll: Add bermello pool to protocol <br>
          Introduction: In order to speed up development, the possibility to run
          a pool is needed to speed up tests before releases; mainly, It is
          usefull to run a pool to complete the PoPW migration, and remove it
          once it is done. <br>
          Proposal: Include a bermello pool into the valid pools list. <br>

        <p> Poll: Freeze forever GPU mined coins. <br>
          Introduction: We all know very well the impact GPU miners had on the
          project. In order to minimize it, we can freeze those coins before any
          monetization is open. Idea is to keep the addresses containing the
          funds freezed at first stage, and then move those funds to a special
          "dead" address, so will be never used. No one, not even the project,
          will get a direct benefit from that. (only the indirect: less coins
          increase others coins relative value) To make it in a safer way, the
          addresses will be locked and then the proofs will be made public.
          Proofs are solid and will include only addresses beyond any rational
          doubt. Total amount is around 100-150K noso. <br>
          Proposal: Freeze all GPU related addresses. This means that this
          address will not be able to send funds again. If any GVT is involved,
          it will be also freezed. <br>

        <p> Poll:Freeze Gpu miners Adresses. <br>
          Introduction: Gpu miners had been swarming around Noso for quite a
          while and they collected between 50k - 300k+ Noso; finally shared the
          source code only after the threat of consequences for those coins,
          which was not even a good code and only after they make a huge profit.

        <p> Poll:Reduce the shares limit per pool each block. <br>
          Introduction: Calculation of 57 shares per block was based in 1 pool
          and a 100 Kh/s miner. Now we have 5 pools and we should try to adjust
          that number to level even more the rewards for small miners,
          discouraging farmers. <br>
          Proposal: Reduce the shares per block to 10 on each pool to keep a
          minimal POW proof without benefit farmers. Idea is to attract the
          higher number of new members to the comunity. <br>

        <p> Poll: Mine undisputed blocks to project address. <br>
          Introduction: Current PoPW system could be hijacked if someone realize
          a DDoS attack to all available pools (paying for a DDoS protection
          service can be a big waste for pool owners, making it unprofitable).
          This will leave the mainnet without a valid besthash to build a new
          block, stopping the block generation under current protocol
          conditions. Since solo is now not allowed, block generation requires
          pools and are only few. <br>
          Proposal: Implement on protocol that blocks without a valid besthash
          are credited to project funds address NpryectdevepmentfundsGE to
          guarantee the blockchain continuity. This will prevent any exploit
          because only benefits the project itself, and protect the blockchain
          against any possible scenario of lack of pools. <br>

        <p> Poll: Create a protocol address to store a governors controlled
          project funds. <br>
          Introduction:<br>
          In order to handle future requirements, project should start to create
          a project funds reserve. Control of those funds could lead to
          problems, so the better way to control it is to implement a special
          address (called Noso_Project_Funds_xx, where xx will be the checksum);
          its funds will be only accessed via GVTs votations (directives). This
          can be done adding a "Special address" on sumary via a especial
          protocol instruction. This address do not have keys (public or
          private), since it will be a special identity inside the protocol,
          only used to store project funds. Apart from the difference to access
          the funds, all other things will be identical to a regular address;
          public, can verifiy its history, get MNs payments, be used to mine,
          etc. <br>

        <p> Poll: Regulate allowed minning pools ownership. <br>
          Introduction: The implemented system for the distribution of new
          coins, POPW, depends on the allowed pools being reliable. It is easy
          to determine if a pool is trying to exploit the system and take action
          against it to suspend it. It is therefore advisable to apply minimum
          criteria to accept new pools. <br>
          Proposal: New pools owners need to be a GVT owner and be approved by a
          GVT votation. <br>

          5%) over the next weeks and start distribution of coins through a
          protocol governed faucet. <br>

        <p> Poll: Reduce PoW reward % to limit GPU miners impact over coins
          distribution? <br>
          Introduction: <br>
          Some weeks ago, due to a sudden increment in the mainnet hashrate, and
          after some forensic study to the blocks solutions, it was clear that
          someone were using a non-public software to win an advantage over
          other miners. It is imposible to know exactly what is the GPU hashrate
          in the mainnet now, but is surely way more than 50%. This is causing
          an unethical and serious damage to the project, unfairly distributing
          coins and discouraging small miners to join or remain in the project;
          we are not actually attractive to miners anyway. <br>
          Proposition: <br>
          Reduce the PoW % from current 52% to 5%, at least until a better
          solution is found. This can be done in less than 24 hours in a safe
          way and should reduce the impact since MNs are already very well
          distributed. Keep a 5% is necessary to secure some miners active,
          needed for block generation currently. <br>

        <p> Poll: Merge MNs and PoS? <br>
          Introduction: <br>
          On the project early stages, PoS payment was implemented to reward
          first holders to keep their coins (hold) This was implemented as a
          temp feature until MNs payment was implemeted. Of course, MNs is
          already implemented, so there is no real need to keep those payments
          separate and continue rewarding "dead" wallets. <br>
          Proposition: <br>
          Merge PoS reward to MNs payment, so the 20% currently distributed
          between all addresses with enough coins are added to the MNs payment;
          this means that 100% passive income will dissapear. <br>
          Options: <br>
          <b>1) [38] Yes, do the merge ASAP.</b><br>
