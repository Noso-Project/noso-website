**Noso explained**

Noso is a sustainable peer-to-peer cryptocurrency and platform designed for accessibility, speed, reliability, and security with minimal transaction costs. Developed by a team with over a decade of expertise in blockchain technology, the Noso platform has been carefully crafted to meet the demands of a dynamic and fast-paced market.

As an open-source project, Noso aims to create a just and sustainable infrastructure for financial and social applications on a global scale. 
The platform employs a democratic governance system (GVT), integrated into the mainnet, to promote community participation and encourage the evolution of the project over time.

Noso funds itself sustainably through the allocation of project funds derived from each block created, fostering a virtuous cycle of growth and stability. By placing sustainability at the forefront of its design, Noso is poised to lead the way in the decentralized financial landscape.
